## 🎬 About the Project

The idea behind **CinePictures** was to modernize a local movie company to replace its old-fashioned manual tracking system with a newer, robust database management system (DBMS). **CinePictures DBMS** consists of 6 entities, with the Tickets entity following a many-to-many relationship between Screenings and Customers.

Developed as a portfolio project for CS340 at Oregon State University, this app demonstrates core database design principles, including a normalized schema, M:N relationships, foreign key constraints, and a custom user interface for administrative purposes.

## ✍️ Credit

- Based on CS340 starter code with added modular routing, UI enhancements, and full PL/SQL integration  
- AI tools were used to build stored procedure templates and validate frontend logic. Manual oversight ensured schema consistency.
- Credit is given to components/code where AI was used on top of the file or top of the function.
